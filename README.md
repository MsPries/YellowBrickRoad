# YellowBrickRoad

You can build your own path, but it will take a little work...

You collect bricks by navigating to the yellow brick factory to the west. You need to get there quickly, as they are one hot commodity! You receive a score upon arrival depending on how many steps you took -- if you take too long, your score will be negative, and the factory will be out of bricks for the day. Furthermore, if the wicked witch catches you arriving with a negative score, she will steal any bricks you already earned.

This repo contains two familiar files -- Learner.py and World.py. It is set up with the same Q-Learning algorithm we explored in the fall, but the world is much bigger. Good thing you and/or your classmates have learned so much about Q-Learning!

You should run Learner.py with Python 3.x and make sure World.py is in the same directory.

**You may not change anything in World.py and may not change the time delay (set by time.sleep() ). You can look at World to understand how Learner works - you won't *accidentally* see the clue, and you should not try to decipher it :)**
